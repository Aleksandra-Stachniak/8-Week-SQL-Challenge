## Case Study Questions - Challenge Payment Question

The Foodie-Fi team wants you to create a new `payments` table for the year 2020 that includes amounts paid by each customer in the `subscriptions` table with the following requirements:

1. monthly payments always occur on the same day of month as the original `start_date` of any monthly paid plan

2. upgrades from basic to monthly or pro plans are reduced by the current paid amount in that month and start immediately

3. upgrades from pro monthly to pro annual are paid at the end of the current billing period and also starts at the end of the month period

4. once a customer churns they will no longer make payments

## Solution:


Creating the `Payments` table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE payments (
    customer_id INTEGER,
    plan_id INTEGER,
    start_date DATE,
    end_date DATE,
    amount DECIMAL(5,2)
);
```

Insert data into the `Payments` table based on the requirements:

```sql
WITH customer_journeys AS (
    SELECT 
        s.customer_id,
        p.plan_name,
        p.plan_id,
        s.start_date,
        LEAD(s.start_date) OVER (PARTITION BY s.customer_id ORDER BY s.start_date) AS next_start_date,
        LEAD(p.plan_name) OVER (PARTITION BY s.customer_id ORDER BY s.start_date) AS next_plan_name
    FROM   foodie_fi.subscriptions s
    JOIN   foodie_fi.plans p ON s.plan_id = p.plan_id
    WHERE  EXTRACT(YEAR FROM s.start_date) = 2020
),
payments AS (
    SELECT 
        s.customer_id,
        p.plan_id,
        s.start_date AS payment_start_date,
        DATE_TRUNC('MONTH', s.start_date) + INTERVAL '1 month' * (EXTRACT(MONTH FROM s.start_date) - 1) AS payment_end_date,
        CASE 
            WHEN p.plan_name = 'basic monthly' THEN 9.90
            WHEN p.plan_name = 'pro monthly' THEN 19.90
            WHEN p.plan_name = 'pro annual' THEN 199.00 / 12
            WHEN p.plan_name = 'churn' THEN 0.00
            ELSE 0.00
        END AS amount
    FROM   customer_journeys s
    JOIN   foodie_fi.plans p ON s.plan_id = p.plan_id
)
SELECT 
    customer_id, 
    plan_id, 
    payment_start_date, 
    payment_end_date, 
    amount
FROM payments
ORDER BY customer_id, plan_id
LIMIT 10;
```

#### Result set:
