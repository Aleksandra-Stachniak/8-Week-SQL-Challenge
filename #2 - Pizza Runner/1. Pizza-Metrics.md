## Solutions:


### 1. How many pizzas were ordered?

```sql
SELECT COUNT(pizza_id) as total_pizzas_ordered
FROM pizza_runner.customer_orders
```

#### Result set:

| total_pizzas_ordered |
| -------------------- |
| 14                   |

---

### 2. How many unique customer orders were made?

```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) as total_unique_orders
FROM pizza_runner.customer_orders
```

#### Result set:

| total_unique_orders |
| ------------------- |
| 10                  |

---

### 3. How many successful orders were delivered by each runner?

```sql
SELECT runner_id, COUNT(order_id) as successful_orders
FROM temp_runner_orders
WHERE cancellation IS NULL
GROUP BY runner_id
```

#### Result set:

| runner_id | successful_orders |
| --------- | ----------------- |
| 1         | 4                 |
| 2         | 3                 |
| 3         | 1                 |

---

### 4. How many of each type of pizza was delivered?

```sql
SELECT 
    pn.pizza_name, 
    COUNT(co.order_id) AS successful_orders
FROM temp_customer_orders co
JOIN temp_runner_orders ro ON co.order_id = ro.order_id
JOIN pizza_runner.pizza_names pn ON co.pizza_id = pn.pizza_id
WHERE ro.cancellation IS NULL
GROUP BY pn.pizza_name
```

#### Result set:

| pizza_name | successful_orders |
| ---------- | ----------------- |
| Vegetarian | 3                 |
| Meatlovers | 9                 |

---

### 5. How many Vegetarian and Meatlovers were ordered by each customer?

```sql
SELECT   
    co.customer_id, 
    pn.pizza_name, 
    COUNT(co.order_id) AS successful_orders
FROM temp_customer_orders co
JOIN temp_runner_orders ro ON co.order_id = ro.order_id
JOIN pizza_runner.pizza_names pn ON co.pizza_id = pn.pizza_id
WHERE ro.cancellation IS NULL
GROUP BY co.customer_id, pn.pizza_name
ORDER BY co.customer_id, successful_orders DESC;
```

#### Result set:

| customer_id | pizza_name | successful_orders |
| ----------- | ---------- | ----------------- |
| 101         | Meatlovers | 2                 |
| 102         | Meatlovers | 2                 |

### 6. What was the maximum number of pizzas delivered in a single order?

```sql
SELECT   
    co.order_id, 
    COUNT(co.pizza_id) AS pizza_count
FROM temp_customer_orders co  
JOIN pizza_runner.pizza_names pn ON co.pizza_id = pn.pizza_id
GROUP BY co.order_id
ORDER BY pizza_count DESC  
LIMIT 1;
```

#### Result set:

| order_id | count |
| -------- | ----- |
| 4        | 3     |

---

### 7. For each customer, how many delivered pizzas had at least 1 change and how many had no changes?

```sql
-- atleast one change --> exclusion or extras  <> null
-- no change --> exclusion or extras == null

SELECT   
    co.customer_id,
    SUM(CASE 
        WHEN co.exclusions IS NOT NULL OR co.extras IS NOT NULL THEN 1 
        ELSE 0 
    END) AS atleast_1_change,
    SUM(CASE 
        WHEN co.exclusions IS NULL AND co.extras IS NULL THEN 1 
        ELSE 0 
    END) AS no_change
FROM temp_customer_orders co  
JOIN temp_runner_orders ro USING (order_id)
WHERE ro.cancellation IS NULL
GROUP BY co.customer_id
ORDER BY co.customer_id;
```

#### Result set:

| customer_id | atleast_1_change | no_change |
| ----------- | ---------------- | --------- |
| 101         | 0                | 2         |
| 102         | 0                | 3         |

SELECT   
    co.customer_id,
    SUM(CASE 
        WHEN co.exclusions IS NOT NULL AND co.extras IS NOT NULL THEN 1 
        ELSE 0 
    END) AS changes_in_both
FROM temp_customer_orders co  
JOIN temp_runner_orders ro USING (order_id)
WHERE ro.cancellation IS NULL
GROUP BY co.customer_id
ORDER BY co.customer_id;

```

#### Result set:

| customer_id | changes_in_both |
| ----------- | --------------- |
| 101         | 0               |

FROM temp_customer_orders
GROUP BY hour_of_day
ORDER BY hour_of_day;
```

#### Result set:
